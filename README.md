# SnoozeCorp

A privacy-first browser extension that blocks websites owned by News Corp and its subsidiaries,
including Fox News, Wall Street Journal, and other Murdoch-controlled media outlets.

- **Cross-Browser**: Compatible with Chrome and Firefox using Manifest V3 and webextension-polyfill
- **User Submissions**: Secure UI for submitting additional domains for review
- **Local Storage**: User-submitted domains stored locally pending manual review
- **Secure Validation**: Comprehensive URL validation following OWASP guidelines
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only activeTab, storage, and scripting permissions
